We recommend using the callsign convention [agency acronym] [last name] and [radio callsign]. Next decide which color your marker will show as on the map. View this table to see which color you should choose.

Finally choose your role based on the table provided. When in doubt choose the Team Member option.

You will be prompted: map.cotak.gov wants to Know your Location. Select “Allow".

If your device has a GPS chip, it will automatically update your location. If not, you will need to manually set your location. Click on the location button on the bottom left corner and select your location on the map.

Moving the map and clicking on your callsign will recenter the map on your location.

To navigate the map, click and drag. To rotate the map, hold control, then click and drag left or right. While holding control, click and drag up or down to change the perspective on the map.  Zoom in and out using the mouse wheel or the plus and minus buttons in the top right corner.

![](assets/2026-01-16-15-17-47-image.png) At the top of the left panel is the search tool. Here you may enter in an address similar to how you would use a navigation system. When you find the correct address, click on it, and your map will automatically position itself at that exact location.

Clicking on any shape will give you access to the same radial menu as for markers and lines. You can edit color, opacity, line style, and center coordinates.

![](assets/2026-01-16-10-40-25-image.png) Allows you to import smaller GeoJSONS. Icons imported this way instead of through the Imports tool show up in "Your Features."  Each feature is editable so you can change the icon type or location. However, they are features on your map, not an overlay, so you can't toggle them on or off.
